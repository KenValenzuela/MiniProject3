# Setting Up GitHub Repository

I'll help you create a GitHub repository and connect it to Vercel. Here's what we need to do:

## Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (if you're logged in)

If you're logged into GitHub CLI, I can create the repo automatically.

## Option 2: Manual Setup (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Create a new repository**:
   - Repository name: `ride-hailing-dashboard` (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: "Sky Harbor Ride-Hailing Analytics Dashboard"
   - Visibility: **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Copy the repository URL** (it will look like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ride-hailing-dashboard.git`)

4. **Tell me the repository URL** and I'll:
   - Add it as a remote
   - Push all the code
   - Connect it to Vercel for automatic deployments

## Option 3: If you have an ASU repo URL

If you have the ASU repository URL, provide it and I can:
1. Clone it to a new location
2. Set it up as your own repo
3. Push to your GitHub account
4. Connect to Vercel

**What's your GitHub username?** Or do you have the ASU repo URL?
